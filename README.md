# PictureViewer
Picture Viewer displays bitmap (bmp) files on a 1.8‚Äù TFT display.
The files are read from a SD card. Both the TFT display and the SD card
use the SPI protocol. The files can be displayed  randomly or sequentially.
Note: The picture file names must have the format picxx.bmp, where xx is a number
      from 1 to 99.
      If you want a picture theme, add a text file named theme.txt containing
      the theme up to 22 charactors.
